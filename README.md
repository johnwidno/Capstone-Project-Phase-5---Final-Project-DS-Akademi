## Introduction
Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) play a vital role in social, educational, and economic development, but they rely heavily on fundraising, which makes understanding donor behavior critical, as one of the major challenges NPOs face is maintaining donor engagement and loyalty over time.

This project aims to tackle this issue by analyzing donor behavior to identify both loyal and at-risk donors. The insights gained will support NPOs in designing more effective fundraising and communication strategies, ultimately enhancing their ability to sustain and grow their initiatives.

## Methodology
 #### **Exploratory data Analysis**
 - data preparation
 - business understanding
 - data understanding
 #### **Major questions**
These questions deepen our grasp of the business and data context, steering the analysis toward the NPO’s core concerns and enabling a thorough exploration of donor dynamics.

This part is crucial, as it serves as a compass that guides our analysis and helps address stakeholders' concerns or uncover relevant information.

## Exploratory data Analysis
### Business understanding 

In today’s fast-evolving fundraising landscape, nonprofit organisations face growing pressure to engage supporters meaningfully, demonstrate impact, and build trust through transparency. Traditional, instinct-driven approaches no longer meet modern donor expectations 

Adopting a data-informed approach is not just a technical upgrade—it’s a cultural shift that aligns mission, message, and measurement. With the right mindset and existing tools, even small organisations can use data to boost engagement and impact (Analytics for Good Institute, 2020).

Delivering measurable change increasingly depends on how well nonprofits engage and retain supporters. As donor expectations rise and attention spans shrink, sustaining long-term relationships becomes a major challenge (Fundraise, 2024). Data-driven organisations are up to three times more likely to achieve mission-aligned growth and build lasting trust (McKinsey & Company, 2021).

Our objectives focus on reducing donor churn, strengthening relationships, and improving alignment between fundraising and impact. We aim to engage donors and inspire new strategies for attraction and retention and show data inpired Analysis and modeling in the context of NPOs.

### Data Understanding 
A synthetic dataset was created to reflect the operational characteristics of a nonprofit focused on youth and community welfare. It includes relational tables for donors, donations, campaigns, impact outcomes, and engagement activities. These tables are structured to support a complete engagement analysis from start to finish.

Although the data is fictitious, it reflects realistic patterns based on sector research. These patterns include donor attrition, variations in donation behavior, and inconsistent campaign performance (Virtuous, 2024). The goal is to encourage the use of data in nonprofit environments and to provide the NPO community with a clear example of what a data-informed approach can accomplish. This simulation allows for open analysis while maintaining privacy and ethical standards.

The structure of the dataset makes it possible to demonstrate how nonprofit engagement can be improved through analytics without relying on sensitive real-world data.

### 3. Project Objectives
General Objective: Develop a predictive machine learning model to help NPOs forecast the likelihood of future donations and improve donor retention strategies.

Specific Objectives:
- Build or simulate a donor dataset with relevant behavioral and demographic variables.
- Clean, preprocess, and explore the data to identify key trends.
- Train and evaluate supervised learning models for donor retention prediction.
- Analyze feature importance to determine which factors most influence donor loyalty.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for NPOs’ fundraising and donor management efforts.

### 6. Expected Deliverables

- Python Notebook (data exploration, modeling, evaluation)
- Cleaned and documented dataset
- Final report (methodology, results, recommendations)
- Presentation or dashboard (PowerPoint, Streamlit, Tableau)

### 7. Expected Results & Impact

- Better understanding of donor loyalty drivers.
- Ability to predict and prevent donor churn.
- Data-driven decision-making to improve fundraising performance.
- A reusable predictive framework for multiple Haitian NGOs.


### 9. Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Excel / Power Query
- Streamlit / Tableau / Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook

### 10. Conclusion

This capstone project demonstrates how machine learning can support Haitian NPOs in strengthening donor relationship management through predictive analytics. 
By identifying potential recurring donors and understanding engagement patterns, NGOs can optimize fundraising strategies and ensure the sustainability of their social missions.
