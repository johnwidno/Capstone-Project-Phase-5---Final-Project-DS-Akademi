## Introduction
Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) play a vital role in social, educational, and economic development, but some, especially in underdeveloped countries like Haiti, rely heavily on gut instinct and traditional methods to make decisions, which leads to poor donor retention, ineffective communication, weak donor interaction, and unsuccessful campaigns.
Since NPOs rely heavily on fundraising, understanding donor behavior is a must, as one of the major challenges NPOs face is maintaining donor engagement and loyalty over time.

The primary objective of this project is to showcase the importance of using data to make informed decisions in NPOs.
For that purpose, the project aims to analyze donor behavior and categorize donors for a random and fictitious organization. The insights gained throughout this analysis will foster the use of data and machine learning in decision-making, which can therefore help NPOs design more effective fundraising and communication strategies, ultimately enhancing their ability to sustain and grow their initiatives.

To achieve this, we use the  [Donor Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maheshpandey87/donor-data/data) from Kaggle, which comprises six tables detailing donors, donations, campaigns, project results, and engagement activities. These data provide a comprehensive view of donor interactions and contributions, forming the basis for our analysis.

 ## Methodology
 #### **Exploratory data Analysis**
 - data preparation
 - business understanding
 - data understanding
 #### **Major questions**
These questions deepen our grasp of the business and data context, steering the analysis toward the NPO’s core concerns and enabling a thorough exploration of donor dynamics.

This part is crucial, as it serves as a compass that guides our analysis and helps address stakeholders' concerns or uncover relevant information.

## Exploratory data Analysis
### Data preparation 
There are 7 tables in the dataset; one of them is a duplicate, so we combined the 6 unique tables. Some columns were reformatted, and the NULL and duplicate values were remove
### Business understanding 

In today’s fast-evolving fundraising landscape, nonprofit organisations face growing pressure to engage supporters meaningfully, demonstrate their impact, and build trust through transparency. Traditional, instinct-driven approaches no longer meet modern donor expectations

Adopting a data-informed approach is not just a technical upgrade—it’s a cultural shift that aligns mission, message, and measurement. With the right mindset and existing tools, even small organisations can use data to boost engagement and impact.

Delivering measurable change increasingly depends on how well nonprofits engage and retain supporters. As donor expectations rise and attention spans shrink, sustaining long-term relationships becomes a major challenge.[McKinsey Global Institute](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/five-facts-how-customer-analytics-boosts-corporate-performance) says that data-driven organisations are 23 times more likely to acquire customers, 6 times as likely to retain customers and 19 times as likely to be profitable, showing the importance of including data in decision making.

Our objectives focus on helping NPO'S reduce donor churn, strengthen their  relationships with donors, and improve alignment between fundraising and impact, with data driven analysis. We aim to help them engage donors and inspire new strategies for attraction and retention.

### Data Understanding 
A synthetic dataset was created to reflect the operational characteristics of a nonprofit organisation, focused on youth and community welfare. It includes relational tables for donors, donations, campaigns, impact outcomes, and engagement activities. These tables are structured to support a complete engagement analysis from start to finish.

Although the data is fictitious, it reflects realistic patterns based on [sector](https://www2.fundsforngos.org/) / [research](https://virtuous.org/resources/resource-center/). These patterns include donor attrition, variations in donation behavior, and inconsistent campaign performance (Virtuous, 2024). The goal is to encourage the use of data in nonprofit environments and to provide the NPO community with a clear example of what a data-informed approach can accomplish. This simulation allows for open analysis while maintaining privacy and ethical standards.

The structure of the dataset makes it possible to demonstrate how nonprofit engagement can be improved through analytics without relying on sensitive real-world data.

### 3. Project Objectives
General Objective: Develop a predictive machine learning model to help NPOs forecast the likelihood of future donations and improve donor retention strategies.

Specific Objectives:
- Train and evaluate supervised learning models for donor retention prediction.
- Analyze feature importance to determine which factors most influence donor loyalty.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for NPOs’ fundraising and donor management efforts.
### 7. Expected Results & Impact

- Better understanding of donor loyalty drivers.
- Ability to predict and prevent donor churn.
- Data-driven decision-making to improve fundraising performance.
- A reusable predictive framework for multiple Haitian NGOs.
